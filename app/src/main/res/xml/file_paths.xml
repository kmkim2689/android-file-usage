<!--
name="name"
A URI path segment. To enforce security, this value hides the name of the subdirectory you're sharing. The subdirectory name for this value is contained in the path attribute.

path="path"
The subdirectory you're sharing. While the name attribute is a URI path segment, the path value is an actual subdirectory name. Notice that the value refers to a subdirectory, not an individual file or files. You can't share a single file by its file name, nor can you specify a subset of files using wildcards.
